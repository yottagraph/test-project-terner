# Build My App

Read the project brief and build the described application.

## Overview

This command reads `DESIGN.md` (which contains the project creator's vision) and implements the described application using standard Nuxt patterns, Vuetify components, and the Lovelace platform's data APIs.

**This is meant to be the first thing a user runs after opening their project in Cursor.**

---

## Step 1: Read the Brief and Design References

Read `DESIGN.md` from the project root.

```bash
cat DESIGN.md
```

Look for a `## Vision` section -- this contains the project creator's description of what they want to build.

**If the file doesn't exist or has no Vision section:**

> No project brief found. That's fine -- tell me what you'd like to build and I'll help you get started!

Stop here and wait for the user to describe what they want.

### Long-form briefs

If the Vision section is long (roughly 500+ words -- a full PRD, spec, or design doc), don't try to hold it all in your head at once. Instead:

1. Read the full Vision section carefully.
2. Extract the **core purpose** (one sentence: what is this app for?).
3. Identify the **MVP feature set** -- the minimum set of features that delivers the core value. Look for explicit priority indicators (P0/P1, "must have" vs "nice to have", numbered phases). If none exist, use your judgment: what's the smallest thing that works end-to-end?
4. Create `design/requirements.md` with your extracted requirements, grouped by priority. This becomes your working checklist.
5. Build the MVP first, then iterate. Don't try to implement every detail from a long brief in one pass.

### Design references

Check for a `## Design References` section in DESIGN.md and for files in `design/references/`:

```bash
ls design/references/ 2>/dev/null
```

If design reference images exist (screenshots from Figma or other design tools):

1. **Examine each image** -- these are design mockups from the project creator showing what the app should look like.
2. Describe what you see in each image: layout structure, navigation patterns, component types, color usage, typography.
3. Map visual elements to **Vuetify components** (cards = `v-card`, data tables = `v-data-table`, navigation drawers = `v-navigation-drawer`, app bars = `v-app-bar`, etc.). If a `vuetify-figma` skill is available in `.agents/skills/`, read it for detailed component mapping guidance.
4. Use the design references alongside the Vision text to plan the UX. The images show _what it should look like_; the Vision text explains _what it should do_.

If a Figma URL is referenced in DESIGN.md, note it for the user but don't attempt to fetch it -- work from the uploaded screenshots and the text brief.

---

## Step 2: Check MCP Servers

Check if Lovelace MCP tools are available by looking at your tool list for
tools like `elemental_get_schema`, `elemental_get_entity`, etc.

**If MCP tools are available:** Great — you have access to Lovelace platform
tools (entity search, market data, news, etc.) that you can use during
development.

**If MCP tools are NOT available:** Check if `.agents/mcp.json` exists:

```bash
cat .agents/mcp.json 2>/dev/null
```

If the file exists but tools aren't showing, they may need to be enabled:

> Your project has Lovelace MCP servers configured (`.agents/mcp.json`),
> but they don't appear to be active yet. Cursor disables new MCP servers
> by default.
>
> Open **Cursor Settings** (Cmd+Shift+J) → **Tools & MCP** and enable the
> `lovelace-*` servers listed there. They should show green toggles when
> active. Let me know when they're enabled (or if you'd like to skip this).

Wait for confirmation before proceeding. If the user skips this step or
the settings panel isn't available (e.g. Cursor Cloud), proceed without
MCP tools — the app can still be built using the Elemental API client
(`useElementalClient()`) directly.

---

## Step 3: Understand the Environment

First, ensure dependencies are installed (types aren't available without this)
and that the local env + MCP config exist:

```bash
test -d node_modules || npm install
test -f .env || node init-project.js --local
```

Both guards are idempotent — they no-op if `node_modules/` / `.env` already
exist. The second line is the same `--local` setup the `npm run dev` predev
hook runs (`test -f .env || node init-project.js --local` in `package.json`);
running it here means the project is runnable right after the build regardless
of whether the user starts with `npm run dev` or `npm run build`. It creates
`.env` from `broadchurch.yaml`, generates `.agents/mcp.json`, and populates the
skills under `.agents/skills/`.

If `.agents/skills/` is still empty afterward, re-run `node init-project.js`.

Then read these files to understand what's available:

1. `DESIGN.md` -- project vision and current status
2. `broadchurch.yaml` -- project config (name, gateway URL, etc.)
3. **The `aether` skill's `data.md` topic** (`.agents/skills/aether/data.md`) — this is critical. It describes the Query Server, the platform's primary data source. Build against platform APIs, not external sources.
4. **`.agents/skills/`** — Each subdirectory is one skill. Start with `.agents/skills/aether/SKILL.md` — it's the index for every Aether topic (architecture, data, UI, agents, MCP, deployment, etc.). Then open each other skill's entry (usually `SKILL.md`) and follow its structure to learn what is documented (APIs, schemas, helpers, etc.).

**Important: Use the platform's data.** This app runs on the Lovelace platform, which provides a Query Server with entities, news, filings, sentiment, relationships, events, and more. Read [`data.md`](../skills/aether/data.md) in the `aether` skill and the other skills under `.agents/skills/` to understand what data is available. Use `getSchema()` to discover entity types and properties at runtime.

Key capabilities:

- **Query Server / Elemental API** -- the primary data source. Use `useElementalClient()` from `@yottagraph-app/elemental-api/client`. See [`data.md`](../skills/aether/data.md) in the `aether` skill.
- **KV storage** -- always available for preferences and lightweight data (see [`pref.md`](../skills/aether/pref.md) in the `aether` skill)
- **Neon Postgres** -- may be available for relational data; see [`storage.md`](../skills/aether/storage.md) in the `aether` skill for how to check and how to use it
- **BigQuery** -- may be available for analytical / warehouse data via the portal gateway. **If the brief mentions BigQuery, analytics, a warehouse, dashboards over event data, or anything in that family, read [`bigquery.md`](../skills/aether/bigquery.md) in the `aether` skill BEFORE writing any code.** A pre-built `server/utils/bigquery.ts` helper is already scaffolded — do NOT add `@google-cloud/bigquery` to `package.json` and do NOT ask the user to paste a service-account key. The build will fail if you try (a prebuild guard catches it).
- **AI agent chat** -- use the `useAgentChat` composable to build a chat UI for deployed agents
- **MCP servers** -- Lovelace MCP servers may be available (check `.agents/mcp.json`)
- **Components** -- Vuetify 3 component library is available

---

## Step 4: Verify Data Availability

Before designing UX, verify that the data your app needs actually exists
in the knowledge graph. This prevents building features around empty data.

**If MCP tools are available:**

```
elemental_get_schema()                          → list entity types, confirm your target types exist
elemental_get_entity(entity="Microsoft")        → verify entity lookup works with a known entity
elemental_get_entity(entity="Apple Inc")        → try another known entity
```

If schema calls succeed but entity lookups return "not found," that means
the entity type exists in the schema but has no data. That's a **data
issue**, not a broken server. Try different, well-known entity names.

**If MCP tools are NOT available, use curl:**

```bash
# Read credentials from broadchurch.yaml
GW=$(grep 'url:' broadchurch.yaml | head -1 | sed 's/.*"\(.*\)".*/\1/')
ORG=$(grep 'org_id:' broadchurch.yaml | sed 's/.*"\(.*\)".*/\1/')
KEY=$(grep 'qs_api_key:' broadchurch.yaml | sed 's/.*"\(.*\)".*/\1/')

# List entity types
curl -s "$GW/api/qs/$ORG/elemental/metadata/schema" -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY"

# Search for a known entity
curl -s "$GW/api/qs/$ORG/entities/search" \
  -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Api-Key: $KEY" \
  -d '{"queries":[{"queryId":1,"query":"Microsoft"}],"maxResults":3,"includeNames":true}'
```

**Document what you find.** If certain entity types have sparse data, note
it in your UX plan. Design features around data that actually exists, and
mark aspirational features (that need more data) as future work.

---

## Step 5: Design the UX

Based on the brief, think about the right UX for this specific problem. Do NOT default to a sidebar-with-tabs layout. Consider:

- **Single-page app** -- if the core experience is one focused view (e.g. a dashboard, a watchlist, a chat interface)
- **Multi-page with navigation** -- if the app has distinct sections. Choose the right nav pattern: sidebar, top tabs, bottom nav, breadcrumbs, etc.
- **Hybrid** -- a primary view with secondary pages accessible from a menu or header

Design the UX around the user's workflow, not around a fixed navigation pattern.

Plan what you'll build:

1. What pages to create in `pages/`
2. What reusable components to extract into `components/`
3. What shared logic belongs in `composables/`
4. What data needs to be persisted (and whether KV or Neon Postgres is appropriate)
5. Whether the app needs AI agents or MCP servers
6. Whether the app needs an agent chat page (use the `useAgentChat` composable)
7. Whether `app.vue` needs a sidebar, tabs, or other navigation (and what it should look like)

Present the plan to the user and ask for approval before proceeding.

---

## Step 6: Build

Implement the plan:

1. Create pages in `pages/` (standard Nuxt file-based routing)
2. Extract reusable components into `components/`
3. Put shared logic in `composables/`
4. If the app needs navigation, add it to `app.vue` or to individual pages
5. Use `useAppFeaturePrefs` / `useGlobalFeaturePrefs` (or `useAppPrefs` / `useGlobalPrefs` for top-level keys) for any persisted settings (see [`pref.md`](../skills/aether/pref.md) in the `aether` skill)
6. Use Vuetify components and the project's dark theme
7. Update `DESIGN.md` with what you built

**Use the pre-built platform utilities:**

- _Client / components:_ `useElementalSchema()` — schema discovery with caching, flavor/PID lookup helpers
- _Client / components:_ `buildGatewayUrl()`, `getApiKey()`, `padNeid()`, `searchEntities()`, `getEntityName()` from `utils/elementalHelpers`
- _Client / components:_ `useElementalClient()` from `@yottagraph-app/elemental-api/client`
- _Server routes:_ `getPropertiesByName()`, `findLinkedCount()`, `getQsSchema()`, `resolveEntityNames()`, `isQsConfigured()` from `server/utils/elementalQs` — server-side QS enrichment (dedup, `data_nindex` resolution, 64-bit-safe IDs). Don't hand-roll gateway/dedup/padding logic; see the `aether` skill's `data.md` § "Pre-Built Helpers".
- _Server routes:_ `callAgent()` + `extractFencedJson()` from `server/utils/agentCall` — one-shot agent calls (resolution / structured output)

**Follow the project's coding conventions:**

- `<script setup lang="ts">` for all Vue components
- TypeScript required
- Composables return `readonly()` refs with explicit setters

---

## Step 7: Verify and Commit

After building, check dependencies are installed and run a build:

```bash
test -d node_modules || npm install
npm run build
```

Fix any build errors.

Then format and commit:

```bash
npm run format
git add -A
git commit -m "[Agent commit] Initial app build from project brief"
```

**Push directly to main. Do NOT create a pull request or a feature branch.**

Pushing to `main` is how this project gets live — creating a PR blocks the
auto-deploy and breaks the smooth first-run experience the user expects
from the wizard. This project's `main` is **not** protected, so
`git push origin main` will succeed.

**How the push goes live depends on hosting** (check `hosting:` in
`broadchurch.yaml`):

- **GKE-hosted (`hosting: gcp`)** — pushing the UI tree triggers
  `deploy-ui.yml` → image build → ArgoCD rolls the Deployment into the
  per-tenant cluster (≈6-11 min `push → live`). There is **no Vercel
  project**; do not wait for or expect a Vercel deploy.
- **Vercel-hosted (legacy BC 1.0, `hosting: vercel` or unset)** — Vercel auto-deploys on push to `main`.

```bash
git push origin main
```

Specifically: do NOT run `gh pr create`, do NOT create a feature
branch, and do NOT push to anything other than `main`. If a push to
`main` fails because of a real permission issue (not branch
protection), report the exact error rather than falling back to a PR.

If running locally (not in Cursor Cloud), the user may prefer a PR-based
workflow — ask before pushing directly to main in that case.

---

## Step 8: Deploy Agents and Next Steps

How agents get deployed depends on hosting (`agent.hosting` in
`broadchurch.yaml`). **Skip `example_agent` either way** — it's a template
placeholder, not a real agent.

- **GKE-hosted (`agent.hosting: gke`, the BC 2.0 default for tenants with
  the agent capability):** the agent **auto-deploys on push**. The same
  `git push origin main` that ships the UI also matches `deploy-agent.yml`'s
  `agents/**` path filter → it builds the agent image and the Portal rolls
  it into the per-tenant cluster via ArgoCD. **You do NOT need to run
  `/deploy_agent`** — pushing is the whole deploy. (The agent layer just
  takes a few extra minutes than the UI to go green.)
- **Agent Engine-hosted (`agent.hosting` unset / `agent_engine`):** push
  does **not** deploy the agent runtime — run `/deploy_agent` for each
  real agent immediately after pushing, don't ask for confirmation, and
  monitor it (see `/deploy_agent` Step 6 for how to poll).

If DESIGN.md explicitly says NOT to deploy, or to wait for confirmation,
respect that. Otherwise don't ask. Only escalate if a deploy fails and you
can't resolve it.

Then present next steps (adjust wording to the tenant's hosting):

> Here's what you can do next:
>
> - **Preview the app** — it deploys automatically on push to `main`
>   (GKE: `deploy-ui.yml` → ArgoCD; Vercel: auto-deploy). Give it a few
>   minutes.
> - **Agents** — on GKE they deploy on the same push (a few minutes
>   behind the UI); on Agent Engine I triggered `/deploy_agent`. I'll let
>   you know when they're registered.
> - **MCP servers** — deploy from the Broadchurch portal or ask me
