# Container image for the Aether tenant app — used by the BC 2.0 tenant
# UI hosting spike (broadchurch ENG-666). Production-ready for both
# Cloud Run-in-tenant (Option A) and a GKE Deployment in the existing
# tenant cluster (Option C); the substrate decision lives in the ADR
# the spike produces.
#
# Build context is the aether-dev repo root. Nuxt's nitro preset
# defaults to `node-server` whenever the VERCEL env var is unset
# (see `nuxt.config.ts` ~L84), so `npm run build` produces a
# self-contained `.output/server/index.mjs` that this image runs.
#
# Local build (needs an AR read token for the private @yottagraph-app scope):
#   AR_NPM_TOKEN="$(gcloud auth print-access-token)" \
#     docker build --secret id=ar_npm_token,env=AR_NPM_TOKEN -t aether-app:dev .
#   docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 aether-app:dev
#   # → open http://localhost:3000
#
# Tenant build (Cloud Build, no local docker daemon required):
#   gcloud builds submit \
#     --tag "us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/${TENANT_PROJECT_ID}/aether/aether-app:v0.1" \
#     --project "${TENANT_PROJECT_ID}" .

# node:24 ships npm 11, matching the npm a modern local machine uses to
# generate package-lock.json. On node:20/22 (npm 10) `npm ci` rejects a
# lockfile written by npm 11, so a developer on a current Mac would hit a
# spurious CI failure unless we pin npm here. Track Node LTS forward as it
# rolls (24 = "Krypton" LTS).

# not the value. deploy-ui.yml mints the token from the github-deploy WIF
